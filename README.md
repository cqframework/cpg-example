# CPG Example

Simplified recommendations for use by demonstration applications to illustrate the [Activity Flow](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cqf-recommendations/activityflow.html) in the Clinical Practice Guidelines implementation guide.

The recommendations in this implementation guide are intentionally not clinical to allow demonstration applications to focus on the infrastructural support for performing activities as part of guideline-directed care.
